## Project Summary

Odyssey is a global vacation review platform where users can log their travel experiences with photos and reviews of the places they visit. Having a centralized review platform allows users to have access to information that is commonly spread across different sources such as hotel, flight, food, and activity recommendations, helping users make informed travel decisions with less work. It will feature an interactive map GUI that dynamically displays important information about a city as well as user reviews, allowing users to explore and read experiences from other users. 

Users will also be able to follow other users, creating a social-media inspired function where users can view their friends' reviews and travel experiences in a feed interface. Furthermore, this website will also feature a heat map that shows trending vacation locations based on the volume of reviews within a time period.

Odyssey utilizes the following datasets: [Global Cost of Living](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living), [Large Dataset of Geotagged Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/habedi/large-dataset-of-geotagged-images), [World Continents, Countries, and Cities](https://www.back4app.com/database/back4app/list-of-all-continents-countries-cities), [Daily Temperatures in Major Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities), and generated user data
