# Team101-TheBig3

### Odyssey 

Project Summary:
This platform is a global vacation review platform where users can log their travel experiences with photos and reviews of the places they visit. It will feature an interactive map GUI that dynamically displays important information about a city as well as user reviews, allowing users to explore and read experiences from other users. Users can also contribute by adding their own entries for locations that they visit.

Users will also be able to follow other users, creating a social-media inspired function where users can view their friends' reviews and travel experiences in a feed interface. Furthermore, this website will also feature a heat map that shows trending vacation locations based on the volume of reviews within a time period.

Description:
This project aims to give users valuable insights about possible vacation destinations that would help them make informed decisions. Users will be able to click on a city to see general information about a city, including costs of living or weather conditions, as well as user entries. These entries can include written reviews about their experiences as well as images. There will also be a search feature, allowing users to search for specific destinations.
